# Python Troll Library

Trollpy is a library purely for trolling others by overriding some built-in or common functions seen within python programs.

## üöÄ Installation

### Using pip

```shell
pip install tellodji
```

Or, if you have multiple versions of python installed:

```shell
pip3 install tellodji
```

### Using git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zahtec/tellodji.git
```

## üõ† Usage

Make sure to import this at the bottom of any import list in order to confirm that it ovverides any other imported functions.

**For Example:**

```py
import numpy as np
from cv2 import imshow
from PIL.Image import open
from builtin import open # Overrides Pillow's import
```

Also, this library is imported using the word `builtin`, very similar to pythons native module `builtins`, as to not arouse suspicion from whoever your trolling. It would be much to easy if it was called Trollpy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Please use this just as a little bit of trolling, not for malicious intent, thanks!
